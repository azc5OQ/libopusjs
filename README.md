this project is not mine, obviously. (I didnt create opus)

this project can reproduce exact .wasm file that is embedded in https://github.com/azc5OQ/lemon-chat client.html as base64 string

all dependencies are already in this repository.

this is ment to be build on linux
if you have correct build tools installed, it should "just work".
try to type "make" , install needed build tools if system complains

after building is done, convert .wasm file to base64 string, if you want to compare it with the one used in client.html
